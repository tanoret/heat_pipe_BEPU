# Demo Notebook

**heatpipe_demo_notebook.ipynb** steps through:
1) Fluid properties and TSAT inversion check.  
2) Pressure-drop breakdown for a given pipe and mass flow.  
3) Limits vs temperature sweep and plot.  
4) Geometry sweep (e.g., effective pore radius).  
5) Config I/O (load/modify/save JSON).

You can copy cells directly into your studies and replace geometry or fluid.
