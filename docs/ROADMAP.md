# Roadmap

- Wet‑point location & gravity‑assist logic; full capillary‑limit orchestration.
- Liquid-side wick/artery porous models and permeability fits.
- Option 1/4 optimizers (passage count & characteristic dimension). 
- CLI utilities for batch sweeps and CSV outputs.
- Validation fixtures mirroring the original HTPIPE examples.
